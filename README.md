Horiseon HTML Work
<br>
I am replacing all of the div elements with semantic HTML elements. Next, I will be adding alt tags to images to ensure accessibility needs are met. Then, I am verifying that the code is correctly communicating with the CSS file. I am also analyzing the overall structure of the code to ensure logical layout. Lastly, I am giving a unique title name.
